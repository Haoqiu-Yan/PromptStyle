DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000031_000000.wav|2102|"'Now, followers of the new God,' said Hokosa, 'raise him from the dead as your Master did!'
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000027_000003.wav|2102|Therefore we will put you to the proof.
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000027_000004.wav|2102|Ho! there, lead forth that evil one.'
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000033_000003.wav|2102|Choose which horn of the bull you will, you hang to one of them, and it shall pierce you.
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000026_000004.wav|2102|He was named Hokosa, a tall, thin man, with a spiritual face and terrible calm eyes.
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000033_000004.wav|2102|This is the sentence of the king, I speak it who am the king's mouth: That you, White Man, who have spoken to us and cheated us these two weary days, be put to death, and that you, his companion who have been silent, be driven from the land.'
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000020_000000.wav|2102|"Yes, viewed from a distance.
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000008_000006.wav|2102|Hence his disappointment.
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000039_000000.wav|2102|"Then perhaps you would like to undertake the mission, mr Owen," said the Deputation briskly; for the reflection stung him, unintentional as it was.
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000040_000000.wav|2102|Owen started.
DUMMY2/5242/35921/5242_35921_000035_000002.wav|2102|Tell them that they desire to hear more of this matter, and if one can be sent to them who has no false tongue; who in all things fulfills the promises of his lips, that they will hearken to him and treat him well, but that for such as you they keep a spear.'"
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000001_000002.wav|1050|We had evidently met just as he was going out.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000061_000000.wav|1050|My lips had barely touched hers, when she started to her feet and snatched up my hat from the chair on which I had placed it.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000003_000000.wav|1050|He threw open the door of a room on the ground floor.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000036_000003.wav|1050|She answered with a sudden self abandonment; she recklessly cast herself loose from the restraints which had held her up to this time.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000035_000002.wav|1050|Do you really care nothing for me?
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000034_000002.wav|1050|Instead of answering her question, I drew her nearer to me-I returned to the forbidden subject of my love.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000029_000000.wav|1050|I drew closer to her.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000000_000001.wav|1050|mrs VAN BRANDT AT HOME.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000042_000002.wav|1050|Leave him at once and forever. Leave him, and come with me to a future that is worthy of you-your future as my wife."
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000022_000002.wav|1050|And an end there shall be.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000045_000000.wav|1050|"I can't tell you-I daren't tell you."
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000066_000005.wav|1050|In her interests, the wise thing and the merciful thing to do was to conciliate the fellow before I left the house.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000069_000003.wav|1050|Did she really believe, when I had heard what passed at the interview, that I should never enter the house again, and never attempt to see her more? And was this the secret of her composure when she heard the date of the dinner appointed for "the day after to morrow"?
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000048_000001.wav|1050|I positively refused to leave her.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000036_000002.wav|1050|Her hand closed on mine, a low sigh fluttered on her lips.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000035_000000.wav|1050|"Look at me," I pleaded, "and tell me the truth.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000062_000001.wav|1050|"He has come back."
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000031_000000.wav|1050|She struggled to free her hand; I still held it.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000070_000001.wav|1050|That farewell kiss, that sudden composure when the day of the dinner was fixed, weighed on my spirits.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000037_000000.wav|1050|"I think of you perpetually," she said.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000023_000000.wav|1050|There was no choice but to answer her.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000040_000000.wav|1050|She threw her arms round my neck, and held me to her with all her strength.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000009_000003.wav|1050|You allow me to be entrapped into receiving you, and you accept as your accomplice mr Van Brandt!
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000057_000001.wav|1050|"I will tell your mother what the obstacle is," she said, thoughtfully.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000005_000001.wav|1050|I knew her Christian name at last, and knew it through Van Brandt.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000050_000000.wav|1050|She looked at me wildly, with a cry of terror.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000040_000002.wav|1050|"Oh, don't tempt me!" she murmured.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000070_000000.wav|1050|Asking myself these questions, I accepted my invitation, and left the house with a heavy heart.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000005_000006.wav|1050|What similarity was perceivable in the sooty London lodging house to remind me of the bailiff's flower scented cottage by the shores of the lake?
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000021_000001.wav|1050|Before I could speak again, she suddenly faced me, and struck her open hand on the table with a passionate resolution which I now saw in her for the first time.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000002_000001.wav|1050|You present the best of all replies to my letter in presenting yourself.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000068_000005.wav|1050|Mary and you partners-eh?
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000074_000001.wav|1050|She looked at me, and spoke to me with a severity which was rare indeed in my experience of her.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000047_000002.wav|1050|Go, if you love me and pity me."
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000029_000003.wav|1050|I took her hand.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000063_000004.wav|1050|I saw in his face that he had some vile motive of his own for trying to take us by surprise, and that the result of the experiment had disappointed him.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000009_000002.wav|1050|Is this worthy of you?
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000031_000002.wav|1050|"There is one thing you haven't told me yet," she said, with a faint, forced smile.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000076_000000.wav|1050|"I expect you to visit a woman who has only to say the word and to be your daughter in law," I interposed.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000069_000000.wav|1050|She had followed us to the door, keeping behind Van Brandt while he was speaking to me.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000078_000000.wav|1050|"Do you mean, George, that you have offered her marriage?"
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000024_000000.wav|1050|"His letter tells me," I said, "that he is mr Van Brandt."
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000017_000002.wav|1050|"Are men all alike?" I heard her say.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000052_000000.wav|1050|She reflected for a moment.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000017_000000.wav|1050|She sat down by the table, and, leaning her arms on it, covered her face with her hands.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000068_000000.wav|1050|His eyes twinkled cunningly.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000063_000002.wav|1050|At the same moment the door of the room opened suddenly and softly.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000028_000000.wav|1050|"You force me to tell you the truth," she went on.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000030_000002.wav|1050|Should I love you as I love you, if you were really unworthy of me?"
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000075_000001.wav|1050|"Is it possible that you expect me to visit a woman, who, by her own confession-"
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000010_000001.wav|1050|They only heightened her color; they only added a new rapture to the luxury of looking at her.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000014_000000.wav|1050|"I have received it, and I have read it."
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000044_000001.wav|1050|What obstacle is there?"
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000005_000004.wav|1050|As the sound caught my ear, the old times and the old faces vanished again from my thoughts as completely as if they had never existed.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000072_000001.wav|1050|"Did the fine weather tempt you, my dear?" She paused, and looked at me more closely. "George!" she exclaimed, "what has happened to you?
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000041_000001.wav|1050|I spoke as recklessly to her as she had spoken to me.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000001_000000.wav|1050|As I lifted my hand to ring the house bell, the door was opened from within, and no less a person than mr Van Brandt himself stood before me.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000041_000000.wav|1050|I was beside myself.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000059_000000.wav|1050|"To morrow, at this time."

DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000066_000002.wav|1050|Had she any open brutality to dread from Van Brandt as soon as my back was turned?
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000077_000000.wav|1050|My mother looked at me in blank dismay.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000068_000007.wav|1050|Shall we say the day after to morrow?"
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000082_000002.wav|1050|"Write down the name and address," she said resignedly.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000023_000001.wav|1050|She was indeed in earnest-vehemently in earnest.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000063_000001.wav|1050|I rose and took my hat to quiet her.
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000003_000002.wav|1050|"Be seated, mr Germaine, I beg of you." He turned to the open door, and called up the stairs, in a loud and confident voice:
DUMMY2/5062/294700/5062_294700_000063_000003.wav|1050|mr Van Brandt came in.
